# OGCWin
OGC Windows Utility is basically just a utility that combines all the scripts I've been using over the years as a Tech into
an easy to use, intuitive utility for Windows gamers with little tech savvy.
It is primarily made for the Oceanic Gaming Community discord members, but seeing as though its a useful utility I figured I'd just make it public.

This repo is still being built. Thanks for your patience.
Currently only the launcher is fully functional and the new pc wizard is being converted to be separate scripts for Windows 10 and 11.

To run the utility use the following command in an Admin Powershell terminal to run the utility for the first time.

Once you've run the command once, a shortcut will be created for OGCWin on your desktop.
