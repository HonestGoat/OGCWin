OGC Windows Utility
This is basically a utility that combines all the scripts I've been using over the years as a Tech into
a easy to use, intuitive utility for Windows gamers. It is primarily made for the Oceanic Gaming Community discord members,
but seeing as though its a useful utility I figured I'd just make it public.

This repo is still being built. Thanks for your patience.

To run the utility use the following command in an Admin Powershell terminal to run the utility for the first time.

Once you've run the command once, a shortcut will be created for OGCWin on your desktop.
